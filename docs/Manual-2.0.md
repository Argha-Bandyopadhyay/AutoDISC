## Introduction
                                       
Welcome to DISC! 

DISC (divisive segmentation and clustering) is an open source MATLAB package for time series idealization (i.e. identifying significant states and transitions). We enhance change-point detection algorithms with divisive clustering to accelerate the typical speed of time-trajectory analysis by orders of magnitude while retaining or improving accuracy. We have designed the DISC framework to be a flexible approach, with applications primarily in single-molecule data, such as smFRET and force spectroscopy. 

Please cite "White, D.S., Goldschen-Ohm, M.P., Goldsmith, R.H., Chanda, B.C., "High-Throughput Single-Molecule Analysis via Divisive Segmentation and Clustering"  if using this software. 

To ensure you have the most up-to-date version of DISC (of which this manual should be reflective of) please see https://github.com/ChandaLab/DISC. 

Any questions, comments, or potential bugs can be reported to David S. White at dwhite7@wisc.edu. 

<a id="getting_started"></a>
## Getting Started

<a id="installation"></a>
### Installing DISC

DISC is written entirely in MATLAB (R2017B and above) and does not require installation beyond obtaining MATLAB. The MATLAB Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox is required. 

<a id="sample_data"></a>
### Sample Data 

For this guide, we will be using the simulated sample data provided in `sample_data/sample_data.mat`.

<a id="running_disco"></a>
## Running DISCO

DISCO is the name we have given the graphical user interface (GUI) for running the DISC algorithm. 

To open DISCO: 

1. Open MATLAB
2. Add DISC folder to your file path
3. Type DISCO into the Command Window

or right click  run DISCO.m in MATLAB's file viewer. 

DISC can be run outside of the GUI using runDISC.m. See [section 8](#disc_no_gui). 

<a id="loading_data"></a>
## Loading Data 

Once DISCO is executed, it will open a window with a prompt to load a data set. Navigate to `DISC/sample_data` and load `sample_data.mat`. See 7.1 for data formats.

Once a data set is loaded, the GUI will initialize and display the first trajectory (Figure 1).

**Figure 1**: DISC GUI Overview

If DISC is already open and you wish to load a different data set: File  Load Data

<a id="navigation_disco"></a>
## Navigation in DISCO 

Trajectories can be navigated by either arrow clicks in the GUI (i.e. "Next ROI (â†’)) or by the keyboard. 

Right arrow
Navigate to next trajectory
Left arrow
Navigate to previous trajectory
Up arrow
Select trajectory
Down arrow
Deselect trajectory
Period /  >
Navigate to next `selected' trajectory
Comma / <
Navigate to previous `'selected trajectory


Adding or modifying existing keys can be done in `src_GUI/roiViewerGUI.m` via `figure1_WindowKeyPressFcn`.

<a id="analyzing_disco"></a>
## Analyzing Trajectories with DISCO

<a id="analyzing_disco_single"></a>
### Single Trajectory Analysis

Trajectories can be analyzed either in or individually at once for a given channel. Let's start by analyzing the first trajectory. 
Figure 2: DISC Parameters window 
1. Click "Analyze" 
2. Input the parameters for the DISC algorithm or used the suggested default values
3. Click "Go"

The trajectory will be analyzed. Black lines appear on the time-trajectory and the histogram plot showing the fit by DISC. In addition, a plot to the right will appear showing the total number of states found and the overall best number of states. 

Note: Deciding which parameters to use will depend on the sort of data you are analyzing. We will provide better benchmarks as DISC gains more use. For now, it is valuable to try different parameters and see what appears to work best. 

<a id="analyzing_disco_all"></a>
### Analyzing an Entire Data Set

Now let's analyze all 100 traces:

1.Click "Analyze All" 
2. Input the parameters for the DISC algorithm or used the suggested default values
3. Click "Go"

A wait-bar will pop up during this process. Once it closes, the analysis is complete. 

Note: This is our suggested method of use for DISC, as this scheme analyzes all trajectories with the statistical assumptions, rather than changing confidence intervals or objective functions per trace to get a desired answer. 

<a id="analyzing_disco_clear"></a>
### Clear Analysis

The results of DISC can be removed either per trace using "Clear Analysis" or for every trajectory using "Clear all Analyses". 

<a id="analyzing_disco_selection"></a>
### Trace Selection / Deselection 

Trajectories can be selected by pressing the up arrow or click the "select" button in the GUI. This will add a field to the rois structure (see 7.1) to be indexed by further analysis by DISC. For example, ROI #24 has a low signal-to-noise ratio and you may not be confident in the analysis results, unlike ROI #22 which has a very high signal-to-noise. Therefore, you may want to Select ROI #24 and Unselect ROI #22 for further analysis. 

By default, all traces are "Unselected" (data.rois(1,1).status == 0). Once traces are selected, you can navigated between only the selected traces using "," or "." on the keyboard or by clicking "Next Selected (>)"  or "Prev Selected (<)" in the GUI. 

<a id="saving"></a>
## Saving Data 

Simply click File  Save Data. See 7.2 for information on DISC output.


<a id="data_format"></a>
## Data Format

<a id="data_format_input"></a>
### Input Data Format

Notation:
"rois" = regions of interest. 
N = number of data points

Data is formatted in data structures with the following required fields: 

| `data` | Data structure to describe the entire data set |
| `data.rois` | Data structure for a specific region of interest (roi) |
| `data.names` | Cell to name the channels (strings) |
| `data.rois.time_series` | Array[N,1] of observed time series for the roi to be analyzed by DISC |

For example, in our simulated data there are 100 trajectories each with 2000 data points. Therefore,

`size(data.rois) = [100 2]`
`size(data.rois(1,1).time_series) = [2000 1]`

where `data.rois(1,1)` indexes the first trajectory of the first channel 

In our simulated data, we have 2 channels, shown by: 

data.names{1} = `Simulated Sampled'
data.names{2} = `Simulated Sampled with True Fits'

This allows different trajectories to be collected from the same roi. For example, in smFRET experiments, it is common to collect the emission time-trajectories of the acceptor, the donor, and the calculated FRET efficiency. If data.names is not provided, default channel names will be given. 

Any other fields in either data or rois is acceptable and will not have an effect on DISC. We find this to be a useful format for including information about our data at various levels. For example, in our sample data, we can retain information about how our data was simulated: 

```
>> data = 

  struct with fields:

                rois: [100x2 struct]
            fcAMP_uM: 1
            Q_matrix: [4x4 double]
     emission_states: [1 1 2 2]
    bound_intensites: [1x1 prob.LognormalDistribution]
     bound_variation: [1x1 prob.ExponentialDistribution]
          duration_s: 200
        frame_rate_s: 0.1000
               names: {'Simulated Sample'  'Simulated Sample with True Fits'}
```
At the data.rois level, we can include information such as DISC fits, signal to noise ratio (SNR), selection status, etc... 

<a id="data_format_disco_output"></a>
### Analysis Output 

runDISC.m (which DISCO calls) returns the structure disc_fit for each roi in data.rois.

For example:

>> data.rois(1,1).disc_fit

ans = 

  struct with fields:

    components: [2x3 double]
         ideal: [2000x1 double]
         class: [2000x1 double]
      n_states: 2
       metrics: [2x1 double]
     all_ideal: [2000x2 double]
    parameters: [1x1 struct]

where: 

| `components` | `[weight, mean, standard deviation]` of each identified state |
| `ideal` | `time_series` fit described by the mean value of each state |
| `class` | `time_series` fit described by the integer of unique states |
| `n_states` | number of states identified |
| `metrics` | all computed information criterion (i.e. BIC) values from agglomerative clustering. |
| `all_ideal` | all possible state sequences from the initial results of divisive segmentation and grouped by agglomerative clustering: 
`all_ideal(:,1)` = 1 state fit; `all_ideal(:,2)` = 2 state fit, etc... |
| `parameters` | all input values used for analysis in DISC (**Figure 2**) |

<a id="disc_no_gui"></a>
## Running DISC outside of the GUI  

where: 

| `input_type` | Either `'alpha_value'` or `'critical_value'` for use in change-point detection |
| `input_value` | Value corresponding to `input_type`. e.g. 0.05 = 95% confidence interval when used with `'alpha_value'`
| `divisive` | Information criterion/objective function for identifying states during the divisive phase (see `computeIC.m` for a list of available options). This value determines the max number of states possible for agglomerative clustering. |
| `agglomerative` | Information criterion/ objective function for identifying states during the agglomerative phase (see `computeIC.m` for a list of available options). This value determines the final number of states returned for fitting by Viterbi. |
| `viterbi` | Iterations of the Viterbi algorithm to identify the most likely hidden state sequence. We recommend 1 or 2 iterations.
0  = do no run Viterbi. |
| `return_k` | Force the number of states you want runDISC.m to return. If `return_k` > # states identified, then the # of states identified will be returned. 
*Note: This is not the suggested use of DISC.* |
