# Divisive Segmentation and Clustering Operator (DISC)

The use of divisive segmentation and clustering (DISC) is an extremely fast and accurate method for  idealizing time series data. DISC was developed for applications in single-molecule data, wherein molecules transitions between different conformational states over time. 


### Installing 

DISC is written entirely in MATLAB (using MATLAB2017b). No installation beyond obtaining MATLAB is required. Simply add the DISC folder to your file path. 

### Sample Data 

Sample data sets are found in  /DISC/sample_data

### Running DISCO

DISC can be run from the command line of MATLAB via

```
DISC
```

or run outside of the GUI using the runDISC.m function. 

## Authors

David S. White conceived and wrote the DISC algorithm as part of his thesis work at UW-Madison. Owen Rafferty developed the GUI for running the DISC algorithm.


### Contact 

All questions and comments pertaining to the use of DISC should be addressed to David S. White at dwhite7@wisc.edu
