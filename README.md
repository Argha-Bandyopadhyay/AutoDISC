DISC is written entirely in MATLAB (using MATLAB2017b). No installation beyond obtaining MATLAB is required. Simply add the DISC folder to your file path. 


### Running DISCO

DISC can be run from the command line of MATLAB via

```
DISC
```

or run outside of the GUI using the runDISC.m function. 

## Authors

David S. White conceived and wrote the DISC algorithm as part of his PhD work at UW-Madison in the labs of Baron Chanda and Randall Goldsmith. Owen Rafferty developed the GUI for running the DISC algorithm.
